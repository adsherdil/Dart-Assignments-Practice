Create a Vehicle class with brand, model, and year properties, and a method called drive() that prints a message indicating that the vehicle is being driven. Then create a Car class that inherits from Vehicle and has a numDoors property. Override the drive() method in the Car class to print a message that includes the number of doors.

class Vehicle {
  String brand;
  String model;
  int year;

  Vehicle(this.brand, this.model, this.year);

  void drive() {
    print("$brand $model ($year) is being driven.");
  }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
  int numDoors;

  Car(String brand, String model, int year, this.numDoors) : super(brand, model, year);

  @override
  void drive() {
    print("$brand $model ($year) with $numDoors doors is being driven.");
  }
}

void main() {
  var car = Car("Suzuki", "Cultus", 2026, 2);
  car.drive();
}
