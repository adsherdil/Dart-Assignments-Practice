Create a Person class with firstName and lastName properties, and a method called fullName() that returns the full name of the person. Then create a Student class that inherits from Person and has a major property. Override the fullName() method in the Student class to include the major in the full name.

class Person {
  String firstName;
  String lastName;

  Person(this.firstName, this.lastName);

  String fullName() {
    return "$firstName $lastName";
  }
}

class Student extends Person {
  String major;

  Student(String firstName, String lastName, this.major)
      : super(firstName, lastName);

  @override
  String fullName() {
    return "${super.fullName()}, $major";
  }
}

void main() {
  var student = Student("adeel", "AD", "BSSE");
  print(student.fullName());
}
